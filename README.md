## Introduction

| ‚ÑπÔ∏è Quonim is currently in beta. User accounts and content may be subject to removal during this testing phase. |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

`Quonim` is a social network where users can freely ask questions, share opinions, and give feedback without the need to disclose their identities. It serves as a valuable resource for individuals seeking honest feedback, enabling them to receive unbiased perspectives from a diverse community. Whether it's gaining insights on personal growth, professional development, or simply satisfying curiosity, Quonim empowers users to explore their questions without fear of judgment or social barriers.

In the current version of Quonim, ***even the platform owner cannot access*** the identities of those who ask questions. It's important to note that while this is the existing behavior, future updates may change this to address legal considerations and maintain a respectful environment by blocking inappropriate users. In case of such changes, this paragraph will no longer appear in the readme, and users will be notified about any updates.
